GitHub Tutorial for Beginners - The Basics.
GitHub allows us to save our code on the web.

Create the project folder and add the desired files
Use "git init"
    "git add ."
    "git commit -m "hello""

Now lets get this to a remore repository

Create a GitHub account or log in.
Select "Create new repository"
Select a name
    Create repository
Connect to the desired repository
    git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME

See the name of the remote repository and the URL
    git remote -v

Up to this point our commits haven't been pushed to the remote repository.
Push our local branches to the remote repository (using -u allows us to)
    git push -u origin master

After this you may be prompted to enter your username and password.
Then you will see that the code got pushed up.

Search for "Caching your GitHub password in Git" so you don't have to enter your password every time.

Clone or download.
Copy the link and create a folder where we will put our repository
To download or clone the entire content of the remote repository use
    git clone linkOfRepo

Add a new dummy file, this change is saved locally
To push it to the remote repository use
    git push

There are two options to download the latest changes in a repository.
    #1
    Using
        git fetch
    With it we can see that there have been changes made, but our code locally won't reflect these changes.

    #2
    Using
        git pull
    Will download the changes and automatically will merge the remote with your local repository.

To cut the connection to a remote repository
    git remote
    git remote rm nameOfConnectedRepo
